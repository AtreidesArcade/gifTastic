Giphy Api/Ajax HW#6

In this assignment, we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of our choice. 

**Star Wars Gif API/Ajax**

Instructions:

*Enter a term into the search box.

*As you enter terms into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear below.

*If you are not sure of a term to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

*The theme is Star Wars so enter a related term or really any items that is of interest to you.
